Pics or it didn't happen!


== TLDR
spider twitter search api
match "@username poidh.*"
was it a reply? if so, find tweet it was in_reply to
log it
bingo!  a list of things people want pics of.

== Random notes
Okay, this will be slow without extra params in twitter search API (needs extras!)
and not have much history until they fix twitter search
so
make a DB table, and dump entries to it
query periodically, add new entries to table (keep ts of last update)
page cache output? (how to flush cache?)

== Eventually
push to a tumblog, ask readers to submit THEIR pics of it.
login via twitter_auth
capture via webcam?
notifications via twitter bot

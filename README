POIDH twitter history search

match @username poidh ***
find post it was in reply to
list of things people want pics of

okay, this will be SLOW without extra api method
and not have much history until they fix twitter search
so
make a DB table, and dump entries to it
query periodically, add new entries to table (keep ts of last update)
page cache output (how to flush cache?)

INSTEAD -- push to a tumblog, ask readers to submit THEIR pics of it.

sign in via twitter
capture webcam?
